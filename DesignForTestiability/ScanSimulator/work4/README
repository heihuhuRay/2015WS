  Installation
  ------------
  Place the installation diskette in a 5 1/4" high-density floppy drive.
  Then make this drive the current drive and run INSTALL.  For example:

      A:
      INSTALL

  Then follow the on-screen instructions.


  Important Information
  ---------------------
  Screen graphics may become corrupted during the Demonstrations of
  TAP Control Testing and Scan Control Testing if the mouse is moved.
  To avoid this problem, use the Space bar to advance the presentation
  during the Demonstration sections.

  Do not execute SCANEDKA.EXE, found on the installation diskette. It
  is a compressed archive used only by INSTALL.EXE.


  Using Scan Educator
  -------------------
  To run Scan Educator, enter the following commands at the DOS prompt:

     C:
     CD \SCANED
     SCANED

  This example assumes you installed on drive C.  If you installed Scan
  Educator on another drive, use the letter of the drive you installed on.


  Using the Scan Educator Simulator
  ---------------------------------
  The Scan Educator Simulator can be used by itself to experiment with
  boundary-scan testing.  The simulator implements the features described
  in the TAP Control Testing and Scan Control Testing sections.  To invoke
  the simulator, run SCANSIM from the \SCANED directory.  For example:

     C:
     CD \SCANED
     SCANSIM
